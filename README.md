# Food-Distrbution and River-Cleanliness Drives
The Robin Hood Army is a volunteer based, zero-funds organization that works to get surplus food from restaurants and the community to serve less fortunate people. Their vision is to beat global hunger and bring out the best of humanity using food as a medium. With the support of local self-sustained chapters for numerous widespread regions, the team hopes to inspire people to give back to those who need it most. 
Apart from food distribution, the NGO also conducts large scale cleanliness drives for water bodies and mangroves. Clean-ups were regularly scheduled for the Mithi River located in Salsette Island, the island of the city of Mumbai, India. In Hindi, Mithi means “sweet”, but the water in this river ceased to be sweet decades ago as a result of dumping of raw sewage, industrial waste and municipal waste into it. If operational, the river serves as an excellent drainage system that is capable of preventing floods in the city. RHA's motto of being part of the solution, not the pollution truly showcases the power that lies in our impact.
